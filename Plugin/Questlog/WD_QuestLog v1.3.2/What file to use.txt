You can choose to use between:

- Regular: If you are new to the plugin or you used version 1.1 (or below) and DIDN'T use RemoveByID, RemoveByName, SetCompletionByID, SetCompletionByName. They won't work with "Regular"
- Compatibility: If you already have Version 1.1 (or below) and used RemoveByID, RemoveByName, SetCompletionByID, SetCompletionByName. They will still work.

Take the .js from the appropriate folder and copy it in the js/plugin folder of your project.
